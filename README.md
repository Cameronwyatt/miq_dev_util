# MiqDevUtil

This is a set of helper classes to make developing in the ManageIQ automate
model less cumbersome. By putting helper code and commonly used methods in this
gem we can reduce the amount of code copied and pasted between methods.

## Installation

    $ gem install miq_dev_util

## Usage

    require 'miq_dev_util'

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
